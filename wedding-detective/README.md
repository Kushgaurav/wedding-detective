# Wedding Detective

Wedding Detective is a comprehensive pre-marital investigation service designed to provide peace of mind before making life-changing decisions. This project includes a full-stack application with a React-based frontend and an Express.js backend, integrated with MongoDB for data storage.

## Features
- **Service Listings**: View detailed investigation packages with pricing in INR (â‚¹).
- **Confidential Consultations**: Securely schedule consultations with investigators.
- **Authentication**: User registration and login with JWT-based authentication.
- **Admin Features**: Manage services and consultations.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## How It Works
1. **Frontend**: Built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS. The frontend communicates with the backend via RESTful APIs.
2. **Backend**: Developed with Express.js, the backend handles API requests, authentication, and database operations.
3. **Database**: MongoDB is used to store user data, services, and consultation requests.

   cd server
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Application

   ```bash
   cd server
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Start the frontend development server:
   ```bash
   cd ..
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Access the application at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Seeding the Database
To populate the database with initial data (services):
```bash
cd server
npm run seed
```

## Deployment
### Backend
1. Set up a MongoDB instance (local or cloud).
2. Configure environment variables in `server/.env`:
   ```env
   MONGODB_URI=<your-mongodb-uri>
   JWT_SECRET=<your-secret-key>
   PORT=5000
   ```
3. Build and start the backend server:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

### Frontend
1. Build the frontend for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
2. Serve the `dist/` directory using a static file server or integrate it with the backend.
